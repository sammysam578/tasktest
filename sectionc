a.final keyword
The final keyword in Java is used to declare constants. When applied to a variable, 
it prevents reassignment; when used with a method, it prevents overriding; and when used with a class, 
it prevents inheritance. For example, final int x = 10; means x cannot be changed.

b. Getter and Setter Methods
Getter and Setter methods are used to access and modify private variables in a class. 
Getters return the value (getName()), while setters assign a new value (setName("John")). 
They support encapsulation by controlling how data is accessed or modified.

c. Inheritance
Inheritance is an object-oriented concept where a subclass acquires properties 
and behaviors of a superclass using the extends keyword. It promotes code reuse and supports hierarchical classification. 
Example: class Dog extends Animal.

d. try-catch block
A try-catch block is used for exception handling in Java. 
The try block contains code that might throw an exception, and the catch block handles the exception. 
It prevents the program from crashing due to runtime errors.
